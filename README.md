# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado board of elections has asked for a python code that will provide the candidate and county voting results of the recent local congressional eletion.  The following are the list of goals for the audit:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast: 369,711
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes:
  -Charles Casper Stockham
  -Diana DeGette
  -Raymon Anthony Doane
3.Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received:

4.Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.  
  -Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  -Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  -Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

## Election Audit Summary
The analysis of the election shows that Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% (272,892) of the popular vote.  The total number of ballots cast was 369,711 votes from the three counties Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe in Colorado.  The candidates in this election were Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. After all ballots were cast and counted the results are Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213), Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892), and Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606).  A lot of the difficulties of this project have been in getting the creation of the text and outputs to be in the format that will correctly show the results of this election.  And keep the named variables consistent within the various statements, though this could be changed for other elections if the for loops are used to encompass larger regions like states.  The varibles can be used to include larger areas for a smaller list of candidates. Or it can be used in local mayoral elections since we can know the size of counties and the possible voter turnout that can be reported.  This also would show us growing trends in population and trends in voting.
